# Next.js Routing: Catch-all vs Dynamic Routes Gotchas

Next.js provides powerful routing capabilities, including dynamic routes and catch-all routes. Let's explore when to use each and how they differ.

### Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes are used when you have a single variable segment in your URL. They're perfect for scenarios where you have a known structure but a dynamic value.

#### Example: Blog Posts

```
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx;
```

This route will match URLs like:

- /blog/my-first-post
- /blog/nextjs-tips

## Catch-all Routes

Catch-all routes are more flexible and can handle multiple dynamic segments. They're ideal when you need to capture an unknown number of parameters.

#### Example: Nested Blog Categories

```
app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx;
```

This route will match URLs like:

- /blog/tech/nextjs/routing
- /blog/lifestyle/travel/europe/france

#### When to Use Each

- Use Dynamic Routes when you have a single, predictable dynamic segment.
- Use Catch-all Routes when you need to handle multiple levels of hierarchy or unknown depth.

## Key Takeaways

> [!TIP]
> ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: You can also create optional catch-all routes using double square brackets: ```[[...slug]]```. This will match the root path as well!

- Dynamic routes are simpler and work well for single-segment variables.
- Catch-all routes offer more flexibility for complex hierarchies.
- Choose based on your URL structure and the level of flexibility you need.
